Call me Ishmael. Some  years  ago  —  never  mind  how  long
— having little  or  no  money  in  my  purse,  and  nothing
to interest me on shore, I thought  I  would  sail  about  a
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have  of
off the spleen, and regulating the circulation.  Whenever  I
myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a  damp,
November in my soul; whenever I  find  myself  involuntarily
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of  every
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such  an  upper
of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to  prevent
from   deliberately   stepping   into   the   street,    and
knocking people’s hats off — then, I account  it  high  time
get to sea as soon as I  can.  This  is  my  substitute  for
and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws  himself
his sword; I quietly take to  the  ship.  There  is  nothing
in this. If they but  knew  it,  almost  all  men  in  their
some time or other, cherish very nearly  the  same  feelings
