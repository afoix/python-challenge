# Challenge 2: Text justification
Hereâ€™s challenge #2! This one is an algorithm you might find in a word processing application: text justification.

Attached to this challenge is a text file. What I want you to do is to read in all the text, and then print it out, adding spaces between the words so that every line is exactly the same length. Fit as many words as you can onto each line, but don't split words in two, if a word won't fit just put it on the next line. Treat non-letter characters the same as letters; you can treat everything in the input as either "space" or "not space".

I want three outputs: 
* One where all the text is spaced to 40 characters.
* One where it is spaced to 50 characters. 
* One where it is spaced to 60 characters.
